# Project 1 - *SimpleTodo*

**SimpleTodo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Joseph Barshay**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list

No additional features have been implemented, due to time constraints.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

GIF created using EZGIF video-to-GIF service. Original video originally recorded on Samsung Galaxy A50 (personal device). Long taps are used to delete items in this case.

## Notes

Navigating the Android libraries for the first time was difficult, even with a walkthrough. Additionally, understanding the definition and usage of views, activities, and adapters is an area I will need to work on. Also, I have limited experience in XML, so I could follow along for the most part, but I would like to get a better understanding of it.
